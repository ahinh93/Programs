<b>Mashups: The new breed of Web app</b><br><br>
Mashups is a recent creation where it attracts users with an eye-catching UI that imports information from other sources. Although there is no new information being generated, the combination of an exciting interface along with convenience from an automated web search turns out to be very desirable. The information being pulled isn’t just from one website exclusively, it is usually 2 or more. The article describes mashups to have different genres; categories include: mapping, video and photo, search and shopping, and news mashups. 
Later on, the article describes challenges that mashup developers face. One issue is being able to easily convert the raw data that the site imports and convert it into presentable and meaningful display for users. It further becomes a challenge when the developers need to work with the raw data where the data can appear to be foreign to them since it’s not their field of expertise. It is still their job to interpret that information, pick out the desirable information, and then present that understanding on their mashup service.
Another challenge in this developing concept in mashing is ethics. How far are developers willing to go in digging for information before they breach sensitive or protected data? Developers today are still testing the waters on that limit.

<br><br><b>Google will search before you even ask</b><br><br>
This article describes the intent of Google’s direction as the future comes before us. As the article is titled, Google wants to be able to offer you search results for your nearby location readily available prior to having entered any information at all. Important information such as your past experiences, personal preferences, and location will be used in the searches. For example, it will notice you rate a genre of restaurants well; therefore results towards that genre will be more likely to appear as a result. 
Google already has Google Maps, which is publicly used and an incredibly powerful tool. The article then reads on that privacy becomes an issue for some users. Some people don’t like the idea of having their phone know their location wherever they are at any given time. While being powerful, the developers should keep in mind if any harm could come from having this auto-search feature be implemented. They must keep in mind as many possible outcomes as possible.
