shm_open() creates a shared-memory object that will serve as the buffer that holds the producer's message. This function, in this example, takes three parameters. The first parameter is the user-defined name of the object. All processes will use this parameter to reference this shared memory-object. The next two paremeters are passed in order to create the object if it previously didn't exist. Finally, the final parameter grants permissions to who can have access to this object. 
ftruncate() takes two parameters. The first is the file descriptor which points to the memory object. The second will specify how many bytes the file descriptor will require. 
mmap() is a function creates a memory-mapped final that also includes the shared-memory object.
