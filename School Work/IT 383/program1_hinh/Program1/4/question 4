getpid() is a function that returns the process' unique ID given by the operating system. When the parent process calls fork(), a child process with the exact same contents is created. The only unique identifier between them is their process id. getpid() will show that the parent pid is a value given by the OS and that getpid() for the child is usually one greater than the parent, otherwise any integer greater than the parent pid. 

fprintf() writes to the file descriptor output specified by the user with the specified message.
