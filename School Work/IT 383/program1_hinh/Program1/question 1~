When fork() is called, the current process creates a child process, which is a new process that takes on the parents' address space. A child process may either be given resources to run either from the operating system or share resources with its parent process. The child process is given a new process id but takes on the parents' id for the ppid. The parent may either continue executing its process or wait until the child process completes its task.
