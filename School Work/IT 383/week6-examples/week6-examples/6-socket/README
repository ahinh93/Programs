Before you run,
change "8989" to your unique 5-digit port number.
The following is the suggested number:
  5+"last 4 digits of your ULID"
For example, if your ULID is XX5432, use
  "55432" as your port number.

Compile both server and client code by running
   javac *.java

[two terminal windows are needed]
1. [window#1] java ./TCPServer
2. [window#2] java ./TCPClient
   type in any message and then press [enter] key

   check what happens
