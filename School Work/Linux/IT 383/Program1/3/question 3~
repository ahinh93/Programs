pipe() uses the UNIX file descriptor table. Similarly to an array, the first three indices are reserved for standard input, standard output, and standard error in that order. The file descriptor, fd[0] is used to access the read-end of the pipe while fd[1] is used to access the write-end. The anonymous 'unnamed' pipe is a one-directional pipe, going from write to read. Typically, the parent process is on the write end and the child process, the other. 
write() takes three parameters in this example. The first is a reference to the file descriptor's write index in order to write to the write-end of the pipe. The second parameter takes a char array which carries the message intended to be passed through the pipe.
