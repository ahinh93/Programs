 Each thread has its own agenda also known as a thread function. When creating a new thread, we will use the pthread library in c. pthread_create() creates a new thread and takes parameters: the first is a pointer to a new pthread_t variable which the identification of the thread will be stored. The second parameter is a pointer to a thread attribute object. This object contains variables or attributes; when we pass NULL, the thread will set its attributes to the default values. The third pointer is a pointer to the thread function and fourth is reserved for arguments intended for the new thread to execute. thread-create.c's original thread continually prints x's to the standard error. Once the new thread is created, that thread will continually print o's. It is important to note that the console is now printing both x's and o's, however the same letter gets printed repeatedly for a short period of time before switching to the other letter and back. pthread_exit is never called therefore both threads will continue to run.
