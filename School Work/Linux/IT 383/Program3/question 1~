In this program, we use a semaphore and a mutex lock. A semaphore puts the system on hold(or wait) for a short amount of time, expecting to release when they're ready. The purpose is to control numerous processes on the same resource, in this case we use a buffer. The number of item within a buffer is limited. The semaphore is responsible for deciding 'when' a process can attempt to modify the buffer while the mutex controls how many processes can call insert_item or remove_item at a time, to just 1 process at a time.
